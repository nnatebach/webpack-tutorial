  <!-- We ONLY need ONE JS file which contains all our codes -->
  <!-- Do this by EXPLICITLY IMPORT all the dependencies inside the JS containing file -->
  <!-- and EXPLICITLY EXPORT the function from the file where the function is defined -->
  <!-- Before having the bundled JS file (bundle.js), we refer our HTML to the entrypoint file (index.js) as the file containing the import of other modules -->
  <!-- As we have the bundle.js file generated by Webpack, we need to refer our HTML to that bundle.js file as it is now the file containing the imports of other modules and it is the result bundled file by Webpack -->
